We aim to develop trustworthy and reliable AI tools to assist dentists in abnormalities in dental radiographs. By supporting clinical decision-making with trustworthy AI models, our ultimate goal is to:
* Enhance diagnostic accuracy.
* Detect early diseases.
* Reduce unnecessary economic and human costs spent on dental X-ray diagnosis.

## **Background**

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that nearly 3.5 billion people worldwide, which is about **50%** of the global population, suffer from some form of oral disease[^1]. In the UK, NHS spends over **Â£3.6 billion** annually to provide dental care[^2]. Dental radiography is an essential tool for diagnosing dental diseases such as tooth decay and gum disease. **46 million** dental X-rays are taken in the UK each year[^3]. However, error rates in interpreting the X-rays by dentists are over **50%**.

There is an urgent need for automated tools to assist dentists in identifying abnormalities in dental X-rays, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy while minimizing unnecessary clinical and economic burdens.
This project is sponsored by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and aims to address this problem[^4].

## **Our model**

We are developing a software as a medical device, which aims to:
* Facilitate the collection and annotation of dental radiographs.
* Assist dentists in identifying diseases on dental X-rays with advanced AI models.

            class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Our AI model is capable of detecting in total **18** categories of dental conditions, including pathologies and non-pathologies.
